# GMD API

An API for working with level files.

**This is not the GDShare mod; it is just the backend tools used for it, and other mods like BetterEdit.**

If you want the actual GDShare mod (which adds buttons to export and import levels), get it here:

<mod:hjfod.gdshare>

Thank you to **Hiimjasmine00** and **Cvolton** for helping!
